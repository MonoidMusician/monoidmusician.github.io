          <p>This is a collection of noteworthy, interesting, and exceptional pieces of art and writing that I view as containing some essence of meaning. It is a celebration of the meaning we discover through creation, marvelling at what others have wrought and shared so that we may appreciate, reflect, and build upon it all.</p>
          <p>For some of these entries, I hope to bring light to lesser-known works that I believe deserve to be more widely appreciated, being worth engaging with, returning to, mulling over, and sharing. Nevertheless, a lot of these entries I think of as “iconic” – not necessarily in the sense of being famous, but because I in fact find myself coming back to them time and time again and sharing them with everyone I meet. Similarly, while some of them are influential in the historic sense, most are influential in the intimate sense that they have had a significant and lasting impact on my personal consciousness and artistic awareness. When possible, I detail the history of my relationship with each entry – most go back several years, having latched onto my mindʼs attention immediately and returning to visit my consciousness many times.</p>
          <p>However I do not believe in worshipping anything or anyone, just appreciating each for what it gives us. I hope you learn and find things you appreciate here!</p>

          <dd data-content="couperin_passacaille">One of the most ornate, elaborate works I have heard from the Baroque era. I adore it! I first heard it on the radio while driving to church when I was 17 or 18. It is pretty repetitive, but thatʼs the point of a passacaille. It reminds me of a deep red tapestry or carpet embroidered with gold in heady patterns of swirls and flourishes.</dd>

          <dd data-content="nancarrow_study21">An absolutely chaotic piece for player piano, well beyond the realm of what could be played by a human. I think it just came across my YouTube suggestions one day, and Iʼve listened to a few other similar pieces by Nancarrow.</dd>

          <dd data-content="stravinsky_chanson">This is one of many pieces in a collection of albums of performances of Mstislav Rostropovich that I got for Christmas of 2014. I find it soothing, plaintive, innocent. I guess it is Stravinskyʼs arrangement for violin and piano of Parashaʼs aria from his 1922 opera Mavra. Itʼs hard to find played on cello elsewhere, and no violinists bring the same flair to it either.</dd>

          <dd data-content="tishchenko_concerto">Another piece from the same collection of Rostropovich, but very angsty and discordant. I listened to this often in the cafeteria at high school to drown out the clamor and sensory overwhelm of lunchtimes. Over the years I have heard more and more structure in the piece and it starts to make more sense in my head.</dd>

          <dd data-content="da_spalla">Ahh how easy Malov makes this suite look on a five-stringed instrument – and not just any five-stringed instrument, but a violoncello da spalla! I always like to comment that this suite sits at the frustrating edge of whatʼs possible to play on a four-stringed ʼcello, as if Bach knew and was playing a joke on us, that we are stuck performing it that way. Relistening to a bit of this before my recital, I was struck at how Malov and I chose similar passages to embellish, but with very different ornaments.</dd>

          <dd data-content="mendelssohn_octet">This is such a classic chamber work that almost every chamber music festival I go to has a sight reading session on this piece, with as many people as want to join. I played it in 2017, as second cello. This particular recording is interesting because of the seating: I most often see it done in “order” (violins, viole, celli, each in numeric order), but this seating of quartet plus reverse quartet actually seems to make a lot of sense in terms of the pairings written into the score, so I wonder if it is what Mendelssohn actually intended – I have no firm analysis or experience with it to say.</dd>

          <dd data-content="orfeo_euridice">This is a stunning staging of one of my favorite operas, with even the conductor and instrumentalists in period costume. I came across this piece in a class on Greek Mythology in music, and I did a paper on operatic iterations of this myth of Orpheus and Eurydice so I listened quite closely to (parts of) this production besides just enjoying it. In my opinion the narrative texture is more substantial than the early Monteverdi iteration, and it is obviously much more serious than Offenbachʼs parody, and I enjoy it for those reasons, besides the musical qualities.</dd>

A good introduction to his views (which I wholeheartedly agree with!) is in an article he wrote for the Atlantic, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/">“The Shallowness of Google Translate”</a>.</dd>

          <dd data-content="tensor_programming">I love the clarity that Conal brings to this subject of highly optimized array processing algorithms. He starts by asking what would the source be for the highly optimized list summation algorithm, why is there all this funny array indexing? Based on the clue of the size needing to be a power of 2, he discovers how a particular shape of binary tree underlies the pattern of array access/recursion. That is, the array indices reflect an underlying tree structure, and that tree structure is also reflected in the pattern of recursion. Along the way he generalizes over generic shapes of trees. He applies this to FFT algorithms, recovering both DIT and DIF and discovering a new implementation. Towards the end of the talk, he mentions that many people view arrays as “closest to machine memory” – but if you think about it, RAM is actually a giant binary tree! Thatʼs my favorite observation.</dd>

          <dd data-content="deferring_details">This paper goes over the details of a simple idea: deferring proof obligations for later, using applicative/monadic syntax. I had this idea independently and was pointed to the paper. It turns out that the obvious implementation (keeping track of a list of independent(!) proof obligations) produces only an applicative functor, but you can upgrade it to a monad with some additional work (by keeping track of proof obligations as a composite type, viz. dependent sums). What I love about this idea is that it captures mathematical practice really nicely: you donʼt want to interrupt a long proof with an unimportant sidequest, you just assume it and provide the proof later. You could of course put it as a lemma, but thatʼs not automatic: it requires you to think about the proper statement and what ingredients you need for it.</dd>

          <dd data-content="parametricity_lem">I regularly share this article with programmers. Having excluded middle obviously breaks parametricity, and this work shows that with univalent foundations, breaking parametricity (at least in this specific way) also recovers excluded middle. My takeaway is that parametricity is a “nice programming property” and LEM is a “nice math property” and so sometimes you want one, sometimes you want the other, depending on what youʼre modelling. In particular, parametricity means that polymorphic functions are transparent in what they do, and LEM grants a secret escape hatch that gives classical reasoning to achieve easier proofs. But you canʼt have it both ways!</dd>

          <dd data-content="dissonance_curve">Starting by comparing pure sine tones, researchers Plomp and Levelt theorized a dissonance curve where two equal sine waves have zero dissonance, then dissonance rises quickly for small differences in pitch but falls off again as the sine tones get further apart. This doesnʼt explain why rational intervals sound consonant: instead, that comes from summing the dissonance levels between pairs of overtones between two timbral sounds (like string timbres, which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency). This resulting compound dissonance curve shows clear dips in dissonance at the expected rational values: perfect fourths, fifths, and major/minor thirds. In particular, since it is a continuous curve it does a better job at explaining perception, where tiny differences in pitch do not affect the perceived consonance, compared to explanations based solely on rational numbers.</dd>

          <dd data-content="sound_from_video">This is a mind-blowing idea: recovering sound from video. It turns out that by tracking subtle shifts in the intensity of pixels across edges, you can recreate approximate waveforms of audio waves passing through flimsy objects – and with a fast enough camera you can get back to the range of audible frequencies. I first heard about it in a news release, near the time of the original research or maybe a couple years later. I donʼt really like Veritasium, but itʼs a fun 11-minute reëxploration of the project.</dd>
