          <!-- I want to create a page on my website of things that have been very … not necessarily influential in like some markèd or specific way for me, but like noteworthy, exceptional, interesting, “famous” (fameworthy), … -->
          <p>This is a collection of noteworthy, interesting, and exceptional pieces of art and writing that I view as containing some essence of meaning. It is a celebration of the meaning we discover through creation, marvelling at what others have wrought and shared so that we may appreciate, reflect, and build upon it all.</p>
          <p>For some of these entries, I hope to bring light to lesser-known works that I believe deserve to be more widely appreciated, being worth engaging with, returning to, mulling over, and sharing. Nevertheless, a lot of these entries I think of as “iconic” – not necessarily in the sense of being famous, but because I in fact find myself coming back to them time and time again and sharing them with everyone I meet. Similarly, while some of them are influential in the historic sense, most are influential in the intimate sense that they have had a significant and lasting impact on my personal consciousness and artistic awareness. When possible, I detail the history of my relationship with each entry – most go back several years, having latched onto my mindʼs attention immediately and returning to visit my consciousness many times.</p>
          <p>However I do not believe in worshipping anything or anyone, just appreciating each for what it gives us. I hope you learn and find things you appreciate here!</p>

        <h4>The Musical</h4>
        <dl class="desc">
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWs4KSQr4Vw">Passacaille da Second Livre de pièces de clavecin, Huitième Ordre (1716)</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by François Couperin (1668–1733)</span></dt>
          <dd>One of the most ornate, elaborate works I have heard from the Baroque era. I adore it! I first heard it on the radio while driving to church when I was 17 or 18. It is pretty repetitive, but thatʼs the point of a passacaille. It reminds me of a deep red tapestry or carpet embroidered with gold in heady patterns of swirls and flourishes.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/AByPgt3Ai8A">Scherzo in G Minor, Op. 13</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Horatio Parker (1863-1919)</span></dt>
          <dd>Another work I heard on the radio, while driving in St. Paul my senior year of high school. Also repetitive (being in the rondo style typical of scherzi), but cute and whimsical.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/f2gVhBxwRqg">Study for Player Piano No. 21 (Canon X)</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Conlon Nancarrow (1912–1997)</span></dt>
          <dd>An absolutely chaotic piece for player piano, well beyond the realm of what could be played by a human. I think it just came across my YouTube suggestions one day, and Iʼve listened to a few other similar pieces by Nancarrow.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY8k2iTCVjE">Russian [Maidenʼs] Song (Chanson Russe)</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), performed by Mstislav Rostropovich</span></dt>
          <dd>This is one of many pieces in a collection of albums of performances of Mstislav Rostropovich that I got for Christmas of 2014. I find it soothing, plaintive, innocent. I guess it is Stravinskyʼs arrangement for violin and piano of Parashaʼs aria from his 1922 opera Mavra. Itʼs hard to find played on cello elsewhere, and no violinists bring the same flair to it either.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/oOqvH8hAv-U">Concerto For Cello, 17 Wind Instruments and Percussion</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Boris Tishchenko (1939–2010), performed by Mstislav Rostropovich</span></dt>
          <dd>Another piece from the same collection of Rostropovich, but very angsty and discordant. I listened to this often in the cafeteria at high school to drown out the clamor and sensory overwhelm of lunchtimes. Over the years I have heard more and more structure in the piece and it starts to make more sense in my head.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/ZDJfmUZPX_A">Dongsok Shin discusses the Lautenwerck & plays J.S. Bach: Prelude, Fugue & Allegro in E-Flat BWV 998</a></dt>
          <dd>I believe this video went a little viral around the time of its posting, being featured in a <a href="https://www.yourclassical.org/story/2021/03/25/bachs-favorite-instrument-youve-probably-never-heard-of-the-longlost-lautenwerck">NPR article</a> that also included an unforgettable quote comparing harpsichords to “two skeletons copulating on a tin roof in a thunderstorm”. The Lautenwerck is a really interesting instrument with a beautiful sound! Interesting scholarly arguments as to why it is the correct instrument to use.</dd>

        <h5>(Chamber & Orchestral) Classics</h5>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>These are works that everyone in my area of music (mostly string chamber music!) will likely be familiar with.</p>
        </div>

          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/9JTH4ZdJcjk">String Octet in E-flat major, Op. 20</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Franz Mendelssohn (1809–1847)</span></dt>
          <dd>This is such a classic chamber work that almost every chamber festival I go to has a sight reading session on this piece, with as many people as want to join. I played it in 2017, as second cello. This particular recording is interesting because of the seating: I most often see it done in “order” (violins, viole, celli, each in numeric order), but this seating of quartet plus reverse quartet actually seems to make a lot of sense in terms of the pairings written into the score, so I wonder if it is what Mendelssohn actually intended – I have no firm analysis or experience with it to say.</dd>

        <h5>Vocal</h5>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>By no means am I a vocal music expert, but I love choral music, I think it has qualities that cannot be conveyed through other instruments. I sang in church choir for many years so many familiar pieces feel particularly comforting. Iʼve started to get into opera music too, mostly early opera (Baroque, pre-Baroque, Classical).</p>

          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/JoOPG4eloPs">Requiem: Out of the Deep</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by John Rutter (1945–)</span></dt>
          <dd>Being a staple piece for cello and choir, Iʼve played this in church several times (including 28 February 2016). This is actually a great recording of it with a wonderfully rich cello sound. My only complaint is that the cello doesnʼt cut through the choir at the climax of the piece.</dd>
          <dt><a class="item" href="https://youtu.be/JUpZ1Npj23M">Orfeo ed Euridice (Vienna version, 1762)</a><br/><span class="info">Composed by Christoph Gluck (1714–1787), starring Bejun Mehta as Orfeo and Eva Liebau as Euridice</span></dt>
          <dd>This is a stunning staging of one of my favorite operas, with even the conductor and instrumentalists in period costume. I came across this piece in a class on Greek Mythology in music, and I did a paper on operatic iterations of this myth of Orpheus and Eurydice so I listened quite closely to (parts of) this production besides just enjoying it. In my opinion the narrative texture is more substantial than the early Monteverdi iteration, and it is obviously much more serious than Offenbachʼs parody, and I enjoy it for those reasons, besides the musical qualities.</dd>

          <dd>This is a mind-blowing idea: recovering sound from video. It turns out that by tracking subtle shifts in the intensity of pixels across edges, you can recreate approximate waveforms of audio waves passing through flimsy objects – and with a fast enough camera you can get back to the range of audible frequencies. I first heard about it in a news release, near the time of the original research or maybe a couple years later. I donʼt really like Veritasium, but itʼs a fun 11-minute retrospective or reëxploration of the project.</dd>

          <dd>I google this regularly to share with programmers. Having excluded middle obviously breaks parametricity, and this work shows that with univalent foundations, breaking parametricity (at least in this specific way) also recovers excluded middle. My takeaway is that parametricity is a “nice programming property” and LEM is a “nice math property” and so sometimes you want one, sometimes you want the other, depending on what you’re modelling. In particular, parametricity means that polymorphic functions are transparent in what they do, and LEM grants a secret escape hatch that gives classical reasoning to achieve easier proofs.</dd>

          <dd>This seems like the ultimate simplicity in flight control: by finely controlling a motorʼs torque during each revolution and coupling these momentum variations into the pitch of the blades, they remove the swashplate (and thus servos) from the equation, demonstrating fully articulated flight with only two motors.</dd>
